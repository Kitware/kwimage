# The Kitware Image Module

The `kwimage` module handles low-level image operations at a high level.
It is a component of `kwil`.


This module contains data structures for image annotation primitives:

* Boxes
* Mask
* Coords

And composites of these primitives:

* Detections
* Polygon
* MultiPolygon
* PolygonList
* MaskList
