# Changelog

This changelog follows the specifications detailed in: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), although we have not yet reached a `1.0.0` release.


## Version 0.9.4 - Unreleased


### Added
* Added "resize" option to `stack_images_grid`
* The `Coords` object now implements `__array__`.
* The `about` parameter for `Polygon` transformations has been
  expanded to include codes: "top,left", "top,right", etc...
* A from_text method for masks.


### Fixed
* Fixed issue in copy methods of polygon and coords


## Version 0.9.3 - Released 2022-07-26


### Fixed
* Issue where `Mask.to_multi_polygon` would break if the underlying data had
  dtype bool.
* Minor issues in heatmap (other than the giant issue that is that class)

### Added
* Support for decomposing projective transforms
* Stack images now can do automatic casting between uint255 and float01


### Changed
* In `warp_affine` change behavior so `border_value` scalars are transformed to tuples instead of 
  the current opencv  behavior where other channels are zeroed.


## Version 0.9.2 - Released 2022-07-01

### Added
* Add `wrap` kwarg to `Boxes.from_slice`

## Version 0.9.1 - Released 2022-06-30


### Added:
* `dsize` arg to `grab_test_image_fpath`

### Fixed:
* `kwimage.Affine.coerce` now correctly respects "about"

### Changed:
* The `kwimage.imread` gdal backend `nodata` argument is deprecated, and should
  now be specified as `nodata_method` to indicate how to handle nodata.
  Specific nodata values that are not embedded in image metadata should be
  handled outside of this function.

## Version 0.9.0 - Released 2022-06-21

### Added:
* Working on QOI support
* Added `kitware_green` and `kitware_blue` "Kitware colors" in `kwimage.Color`.
* Type annotations stubs


### Changed:

* Moved binary backends to `kwimage_ext` module as optional dependencies. Kwimage is now a pure python package. 


## Version 0.8.6 - Released 2022-04-27

### Added:
* Intention: ndarray functions in kwimage and kwarray should respect masked arrays.

### Changed:
* Deprecate using overview=-1 to get the coarsest overview. Use the string "coarsest" instead.
* The "overview" argument to gdal now uses 0-based indexing such that overview=0 is no overview, 
  and overview=1 is the first overview. This corresponds to the scale being `2^{overview}`.


## Version 0.8.5 - Released 2022-04-19

### Added:
* `kwimage.Affine.to_shapely` method for converting affine transforms to shapely-style 

### Fixed
* Fix issue in `Polygon.draw` where facecolor and edgecolor were not respected.
* Added `to_shapely` for `kwimage.Affine`
* Issue in `kwimage.load_image_shape` when using pathlib.Path


## Version 0.8.4 - Released 2022-04-02

### Fixed
* Bug in `Detections.draw_on(..., color='classes')` when a class is unknown
* Added workaround to cv2 bug to `Polygon.draw_on` when polygon coordinates are
  too large. Currently clips the polygon and emits a warning, this prevents
  crashes, but results may not be correct.


### Changed
* `Boxes.from_slice` no longer handles wraparound slices as it is not well
  defined and previous behavior was buggy.


## Version 0.8.3 - Released 2022-03-28

### Added
* facecolor and edgecolor in `Polygon.draw_on`

### Fixed
* Bug in MultiPolygon draw, `Polygon.draw_on` no longer crashes when polygon is empty.

* Speed up drawing in PolygonList and other generic draw funcs
* improve checkerboard

### Changed
* Consolidated environment variables in a new `kwiamge._internal` module.

### Fixed

## Version 0.7.17 - Released 2021-12-16

### Added

  functionality to exclude existing colors.


### Fixed

* Serious bug in `kwimage.Affine`, where `decompose` and `affine` were not
  inverse. Behavior of kwimage.Affine with shear is now deprecated as it was
  inconsistent. New parameter that impacts shear is `xshear`.

  points or areas. The latter uses a rasterio contour finding mechanism.
* `imread` gdalbackend can now read from overviews if they exist.

### Fixed:
* `warp_affine` now properly raises an error when cv2.warpAffine raises an unhandled error
* Polygon to/from methods now handle the empty polygon case

### Changed
* Using `math` is much faster than `numpy` for scalars, switching to that in kwimage.Affine
* Added default behavior to `draw_text_on_image` when origin is unspecified.
* Polygon and MultiPolygon coerce work better with geojson
* Work on new robust normalizers (see `normalize_intensity`)
